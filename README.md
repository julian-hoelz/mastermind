## Game Description

The goal of the game is to crack the code that the computer randomly generates at the start of the game. You have seven attempts to do so.<br>
The code consists of four balls, each of which has one of six possible colours. Red and white pins help you crack the code.<br>
A red pin means that a colour is correct and in the correct position. A white pin means that a colour is correct but not in the correct position.
